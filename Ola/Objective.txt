Problem Statement
Recruiting and retaining drivers is seen by industry watchers as a tough battle for Ola. Churn among drivers is high and it’s very easy for drivers to stop working for the service on the fly or jump to Uber depending on the rates.
As the companies get bigger, the high churn could become a bigger problem. To find new drivers, Ola is casting a wide net, including people who don’t have cars for jobs. But this acquisition is really costly. 
Losing drivers frequently impacts the morale of the organization and acquiring new drivers is more expensive than retaining existing ones.
You are working as a data scientist with the Analytics Department of Ola, focused on driver team attrition. You are provided with the monthly information for a segment of drivers for 2019 and 2020 and tasked to predict whether a driver will be leaving the company or not based on their attributes like

Demographics (city, age, gender etc.)
Tenure information (joining date, Last Date)
Historical data regarding the performance of the driver (Quarterly rating, Monthly business acquired, grade, Income)

Dataset Link: ola_driver.csv

Column Profiling:

MMMM-YY : Reporting Date (Monthly)
Driver_ID : Unique id for drivers
Age : Age of the driver
Gender : Gender of the driver – Male : 0, Female: 1
City : City Code of the driver
Education_Level : Education level – 0 for 10+ ,1 for 12+ ,2 for graduate
Income : Monthly average Income of the driver
Date Of Joining : Joining date for the driver
LastWorkingDate : Last date of working for the driver
Joining Designation : Designation of the driver at the time of joining
Grade : Grade of the driver at the time of reporting
Total Business Value : The total business value acquired by the driver in a month (negative business indicates cancellation/refund or car EMI adjustments)
Quarterly Rating : Quarterly rating of the driver: 1,2,3,4,5 (higher is better)

Concepts Tested:

Ensemble Learning- Bagging
Ensemble Learning- Boosting
KNN Imputation of Missing Values
Working with an imbalanced dataset

What "good" looks like:

Import the dataset and do usual exploratory analysis steps like checking the structure & characteristics of the dataset.

Convert date-like features to their respective data type

Check for missing values and Prepare data for KNN Imputation

You may consider only numerical features for this purpose

Aggregate data in order to remove multiple occurrences of same driver data (We did something similar in Delhivery business Case)

You can start from storing unique Driver IDs in an empty dataframe and then bring all the features at same level (Groupby Driver ID)

Feature Engineering Steps:

Create a column which tells whether the quarterly rating has increased for that driver - for those whose quarterly rating has increased we assign the value 1

Target variable creation: Create a column called target which tells whether the driver has left the company- driver whose last working day is present will have the value 1

Create a column which tells whether the monthly income has increased for that driver - for those whose monthly income has increased we assign the value 1

Statistical summary of the derived dataset

Check correlation among independent variables and how they interact with each other

Approach:
- Transform Features:
	- 'MMM-YY': Service in months (Count)
	- 'Age': Mean
	- 'Gender': Unique
	- 'City': Unique
	- 'Education_Level':Unique
	- 'Income',: Mean, Recent
	- 'Dateofjoining': Month, Year
	- 'LastWorkingDate': Remove
	- 'Joining Designation': Unique
	- 'Grade',: Current-Initial, Recent
	- 'Total Business Value': Mean, No. of neg business value
	- 'Quarterly Rating': Current-Initial, Recent
	- 'LWD_Flag': Target (Max)

Steps:
- Basic data analysis
- Group data based on Driver ID
- EDA
	- UVA, BVA, MVA
- Statistical Analysis
	- T-Test, Chi square test
- Feature Transformation
	- Categorical Encoding
	- No scaling, as it is not required for tree based models
- Modeling
	- Logistic Regression
	- Decision Tree Classifier
	- Random Forest Model
	- Gradient Boosting Classifier
	- XGBoost


Insights:
- Unnamed: 0 contains unique values, doesn't helpful for EDA and model building
- 24 reporting days of drivers are collected in the dataset
- Total number of drivers in the dataset are 2381 (Active: 765, Churned: 1616)
- No. of Cities: 29
- Average Income and Recent Income follows same distribution, also confirmed with kruskal walis test
- Average Business Value is significantly right skewed
- All the numerical features are severly affected with outliers
- After removing na values, Lastworkingdate - JoiningDate calculation gives many negative values indicating many errors in joining date column
- Most drivers are having quarterly rating of 1, indicating poor performance and Over 90% of drivers are graded between 1-3 (Average rating)
- Change in Quarterly Rating typically follows a normal distribution centered at 0, showing that most drivers experience no significant change in their ratings
- No of Negative Business Value rarely occurs, indicating minimal influence on driver churn prediction
- Joining designation of over 95% of drivers are at grades 1-3, with grade 1 signifying novice drivers.
- Majority of the drivers are joined after 2018, suggesting business growth and momentum post-2018
- Education Level is equally distributed among drivers, indicating no strong correlation with churn. Also confirmed in the feature importance score of the model.
- The dataset is heavily imbalanced with churned drivers of 68% and loyal/active drivers of 32%
- Churning behaviors:
	- Drivers with grades 1 and 2 are highly likely to churn, while those with grades 3-5 are very unlikely to churn
	- Drivers with joining designations of 1 and 2 tend to churn more frequently
	- Drivers with a large number of negative business values are highly likely to churn
	- Drivers with a recent quarterly rating of 1 are very highly likely to churn
	- Drivers with a positive change in their quarterly rating are very unlikely to churn
	- Drivers who joined in 2020 are very unlikely to churn
	- Drivers from city C20 are highly likely to churn, while those from city C29 are less likely to churn
	- Drivers with longer service durations are less likely to churn
	- Drivers contributing less business value are highly likely to churn
	- Drivers earning below-average income are highly likely to churn
	- Interestingly, Highly rated drivers or drivers with increase in quarterly rating churns more
	- Drivers with more number of negative business values churn less likely
	- Grade change and higher recent grade shows high possibility for churning, also confirmed it in the feature importance score of the model
- Mean Age of drivers doesn't show significant relation to distinguish between churn and non churn drivers, hence the feature may not support model for prediction
- Gender, Education Level and No. of negative business value features doesn't show significant relation with the churning of drivers and modeling results confirms the same	
- Both QQPlot and Shapiro wilk test confirms that none of the numerical features follow normal distribution
