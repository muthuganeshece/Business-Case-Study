Hints:
The exploration should have a goal. As you explore the data, keep in mind that you want to answer which type of shows to produce and how to grow the business.
Ensure each recommendation is backed by data. The company is looking for data-driven insights, not personal opinions or anecdotes.
Assume that you are presenting your findings to business executives who have only a basic understanding of data science. Avoid unnecessary technical jargon.
Start by exploring a few questions: What type of content is available in different countries?
How has the number of movies released per year changed over the last 20-30 years?
Comparison of tv shows vs. movies.
What is the best time to launch a TV show?
Analysis of actors/directors of different types of shows/movies.
Does Netflix has more focus on TV Shows than movies in recent years
Understanding what content is available in different countries

7. Business Insights (10 Points) - Should include patterns observed in the data along with what you can infer from it

8. Recommendations (10 Points) - Actionable items for business. No technical jargon. No complications. Simple action items that everyone can understand

Submission Process:

Type your insights and recommendations in the rich-text editor.
Convert your jupyter notebook into PDF (Save as PDF using Chrome browser’s Print command), upload it in your Google Drive (set the permission to allow public access), and paste that link in the text editor.
Alternatively, you can directly submit your PDF on the portal.
Optionally, you may add images/graphs in the text editor by taking screenshots or saving matplotlib graphs using plt.savefig(...).
After submitting, you will not be allowed to edit your submission.


Data analysis:
- Datatype: 
	- Convert date_added to datetime
	- Except year all are categorical data
- Unique: 
	- There should be some typo in the country as there are only 190 countries are recognised
- Missing values:
- 

Data Cleaning:
- Fill missing values
- 

EDA:
- No of movies by month (2 plots one for movies and one for shows)
- Avg no. of days between releases
- No. of days between release year and date added
- Find unique value of movie category and each category vs year
	- Find movie share between categories
	

Recommendations:
1. Contains movies predominantly of higher age groups, including a lot of animation movies of kids intrest will attract more customers of that age
2. Totally movies from 123 countries are included, including movies from remaining countries (~70) increases the customer base from those countries
