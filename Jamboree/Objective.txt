Jamboree has helped thousands of students like you make it to top colleges abroad. Be it GMAT, GRE or SAT, their unique problem-solving methods ensure maximum scores with minimum effort.
They recently launched a feature where students/learners can come to their website and check their probability of getting into the IVY league college. 
This feature estimates the chances of graduate admission from an Indian perspective.


How can you help here?

Your analysis will help Jamboree in understanding what factors are important in graduate admissions and how these factors are interrelated among themselves. 
It will also help predict one's chances of admission given the rest of the variables.

Exploratory Data Analysis
Linear Regression

What does good looks like?

Import the dataset and do usual exploratory data analysis steps like checking the structure & characteristics of the dataset.
Drop the unique row Identifier if you see any. This step is important as you don’t want your model to build some understanding based on row numbers.
Use Non-graphical and graphical analysis for getting inferences about variables.
This can be done by checking the distribution of variables of graduate applicants.
Once you’ve ensured that students with varied merit apply for the university, you can start understanding the relationship between different factors responsible for graduate admissions.
Check correlation among independent variables and how they interact with each other.
Use Linear Regression from (Statsmodel library) and explain the results.
Test the assumptions of linear regression:
Multicollinearity check by VIF score
Mean of residuals
Linearity of variables (no pattern in residual plot)
Test for Homoscedasticity
Normality of residuals
Do model evaluation- MAE, RMSE, R2 score, Adjusted R2.
Provide actionable Insights & Recommendations
Try out different Linear Regressions

GRE Score: Normally distributed and no iqr outliers are observed

- Data Characteristics
	- **Serial No.**: 
		- All are Unique values might not be helpful for prediction, hence should be ignored before prediction
	- **GRE Score, TOEFL Score**: 
		- Mean ~= Median indicating Central Tendency
		- Data is distributed normally and having spread out peak or flat peak
		- No gaps in distribution plot indicates the data is Continuous with no missing range 
	- **Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA)**: 
		- Ranges from 6.8 to 9.92, 
		- Data is distributed normally and having sharp peak
		- Gap between 7 and 7.5 in the distribution plot indicates the missing range in the data
	- **University Rating**: 
		- Ordinal Feature ranges from 1 to 5
		- Ratings in the range 2-4 being 80% of proportion
		- Average rated universities (3) are the most in dataset
	- ** Statement of Purpose (SOP)**: 
		- Ordinal Feature ranges from 1 to 5 with resolution 0.5
		- Strength in the range 2.5-4.5 being 80% of proportion
		- Lowest strength (1) is neglegible (1.2%) and can be ignored or merged
	- **Letter of Recommendation (LOR)**: 
		- Ordinal Feature ranges from 1 to 5 with resolution 0.5
		- Strength in the range 3-4 being ~60% of proportion
		- Lowest strength (1) is neglegible (0.2%)
	- **Research**: 
		- Binary categorical feature with equal distribution		
	- **Change of Admit**: 
		- Probability of getting Admission ranges from 0.4 to 1
- Exploratory Data Analysis		
	- No null values and no iqr outliers are identified indicating clean dataset
	- Students from universities with higher ratings (3+) are more likely to have research experience
	- Students having research experience are more likely to have higher SOP and LOR strengths (3+)
	- Students having research experience are mostly likely to get higher scores in GRE, TOEFL and Curriculum
	- Strength of relationship between categorical features: (University rating and SOP) > (University rating and LOR) > (SOP and LOR)
	- All 3 numerical features are highly linearly correlated
	- Students having high CGPA are more likely to have higher GRE and TOEFL Score
	- Students scored more in the GRE, TOEFL and Curriculum are having higher SOP strength, LOR strength
	- Balanced distribution of the target is observed for <0.5 (~50%) and > 0.5 (~50%)
	- GRE Score, TOEFL Score and CGPA all are linearly correlated with Chance of getting Admission
	- University rating, SOP, LOR and Research experience are positively and linearly correlated with Chance of Admission
	
Recommendations:
- Data Preprocessing:
	- SOP: Ratings 1, 1.5 and 2.0 can be merged, 4.5 and 5.0 can be merged
	- LOR: Ratings 1, 1.5, 2.0 and 2.5 can be merged, 4.5 and 5.0 can be merged
	- University Rating: Ratings 1 and 2 can be merged, 4 and 5 can be merged
	- Transform all the ratings to ordinal categorical data
