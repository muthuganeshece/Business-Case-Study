What does “good” look like?

- Import the dataset and do usual exploratory data analysis steps like checking the structure & characteristics of the dataset
- Checking unique emails and frequency of occurrence of the same email hash in the data. Recording observation and inference, wherever necessary.
- Checking for missing values and Prepare data for KNN/ Mean Imputation.
- You may have to remove special characters from the dataset by using Regex
	- Don’t worry if you haven’t used that before. The syntax is quite simple and intuitive
	- Code:
		mystring='\tAirtel X Labs'
		re.sub('[^A-Za-z0-9 ]+', '', mystring)
- Checking for duplicates in the dataset and drop them
- Making some new features like adding ‘Years of Experience’ column by subtracting orgyear from current year
- Manual Clustering on the basis of learner’s company, job position and years of experience
- Getting the 5 point summary of CTC (mean, median, max, min, count etc) on the basis of Company, Job Position, Years of Experience
- Merging the same with original dataset carefully and creating some flags showing learners with CTC greater than the Average of their Company’s department having same Years of Experience 
	- Call that flag designation with values [1,2,3]
- Doing above analysis at Company & Job Position level. Name that flag Class with values [1,2,3]
- Repeating the same analysis at the Company level. Name that flag Tier with values [1,2,3]

Based on the manual clustering done so far, answering few questions like:
- Top 10 employees (earning more than most of the employees in the company) - Tier 1
- Top 10 employees of data science in each company earning more than their peers - Class 1
- Bottom 10 employees of data science in each company earning less than their peers - Class 3
- Bottom 10 employees (earning less than most of the employees in the company)- Tier 3
- Top 10 employees in each company - X department - having 5/6/7 years of experience earning more than their peers - Tier X
- Top 10 companies (based on their CTC)
- Top 2 positions in every company (based on their CTC)
 
- Data processing for Unsupervised clustering - Label encoding/ One- hot encoding, Standardization of data
- Unsupervised Learning - Clustering
- Checking clustering tendency
- Elbow method
- K-means clustering
- Hierarchical clustering (you can do this on a sample of the dataset if your process is taking time)
- Insights from Unsupervised Clustering
