Yulu has recently suffered considerable dips in its revenues. They have contracted a consulting company to understand the factors on which the demand for these shared electric cycles depends. 
Specifically, they want to understand the factors affecting the demand for these shared electric cycles in the Indian market.

How you can help here?

The company wants to know:

Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared electric cycles in the Indian market?
How well those variables describe the electric cycle demands

Concept Used:

Bi-Variate Analysis
2-sample t-test: testing for difference across populations
ANNOVA
Chi-square
How to begin:

Import the dataset and do usual exploratory data analysis steps like checking the structure & characteristics of the dataset
Try establishing a relation between the dependent and independent variable (Dependent “Count” & Independent: Workingday, Weather, Season etc)
Select an appropriate test to check whether:
Working Day has effect on number of electric cycles rented
No. of cycles rented similar or different in different seasons
No. of cycles rented similar or different in different weather
Weather is dependent on season (check between 2 predictor variable)
Set up Null Hypothesis (H0)
State the alternate hypothesis (H1)
Check assumptions of the test (Normality, Equal Variance). You can check it using Histogram, Q-Q plot or statistical methods like levene’s test, Shapiro-wilk test (optional)
Please continue doing the analysis even If some assumptions fail (levene’s test or Shapiro-wilk test) but double check using visual analysis and report wherever necessary
Set a significance level (alpha)
Calculate test Statistics.
Decision to accept or reject null hypothesis.

1. Weather-Based Insights:
- Obseravation: 
	- Light weather conditions (Weather 1 and 2) see high usage of the cycles.
- Recommendation: 
	- Focus marketing efforts and offer discounts or reduced costs during Weather 1 and 2 conditions to capitalize on high demand
	- Hypothesis test also concludes that Average number of cycles rented is significantly different for weather 1 and 2. Hence the strategies involving weather 1 and 2 will make a significant impact whereas the weather 2 doesn't.
	- Utilize dynamic pricing models that adjust costs based on real-time weather conditions, prioritizing Weather 1 for promotions to maximize revenue.

2. Weekly usage-Based Insights:
- Obseravation: 
	- Registered users are predominant on weekdays indicates tbat they rent cycles for commuting to work/students
	- Casual users are predominant on weekends indicating that they commute for leisure
	- Users count during holiday and working day also confirms the above point
- Recommendation:
	- Increase efforts to grow the registered user base to boost weekday revenue, as they tend to have higher usage rates
	- Introduce weekday subscription plans or loyalty programs for registered users to encourage frequent use
	- On weekends, tailor promotions and offers to attract casual users with leisure-oriented marketing
	- Design weekend packages that appeal to casual users, such as group discounts or event partnerships

3. YoY Growth Insights:
- Obseravation: 
	- Year-over-year (YoY) user growth indicates that current promotion strategies are effective.
- Recommendation:
	- Continue and refine existing promotional strategies that have proven successful.
	- Analyze which promotional channels and messages have driven the most growth and amplify those efforts.

4. Time-Based Insights:
- Obseravation:
	- The average number of casual users peaks between 13:00 and 17:00, indicating high demand during these hours.
- Recommendation: 
	- Implement dynamic pricing during peak hours to manage demand and maximize revenue. Adjust pricing to reflect the higher value of cycles during peak usage times
	- Set up a pricing model that increases rates during peak hours (13:00-17:00) while offering discounts during off-peak times to balance demand throughout the day

5. Temperature-Based Insights:
- Observation: 
	- Cycle usage is positively correlated with temperature 
- Recommendation:
	- Hypothesis testing confirms that the average number of cycles rented varies significantly with temperature. Hence the strategies involving temperature bin will make a significant impact
	- Incorporate temperature data into dynamic pricing models. Increase prices during favorable temperature conditions (higher usage) and consider lowering prices or offering incentives when conditions are less ideal.
	- Utilize accurate weather prediction APIs to anticipate demand and adjust pricing accordingly.

6. Humidity-Based Insights:
- Observation:
	- Cycle usage is negatively correlated with humidity 
- Recommendation:
	- Hypothesis testing confirms that the average number of cycles rented varies significantly with humidity. Hence the strategies involving humidity will make a significant impact
	- Incorporate humidity data into dynamic pricing models. IAdjust pricing based on humidity levels to encourage usage during less favorable conditions.
	- Utilize accurate weather prediction APIs to anticipate demand and adjust pricing accordingly.

7. Day-Based Insights:
- Observation:
	- The average number of cycles rented is not significantly different between working days and non-working days
- Recommendation:
	- The strategies involving working day doesn't significantly impact
	- Maintain consistent pricing across working and non-working days

8. Season-Based Insights:
- Observation:
	- The average number of cycles rented varies significantly between seasons
- Recommendation:
	- The strategies involving each seasons will make significantly impact
	- Increase prices during peak seasons with high demand and offer discounts or promotions during off-peak seasons to encourage usage
	- Create seasonal marketing campaigns that highlight the benefits of cycling in each season
