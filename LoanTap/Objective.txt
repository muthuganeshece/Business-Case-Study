LoanTap is an online platform committed to delivering customized loan products to millennials. They innovate in an otherwise dull loan segment, to deliver instant, flexible loans on consumer friendly terms to 
salaried professionals and businessmen.
The data science team at LoanTap is building an underwriting layer to determine the creditworthiness of MSMEs as well as individuals.
LoanTap deploys formal credit to salaried individuals and businesses 4 main financial instruments:
- Personal Loan
- EMI Free Loan
- Personal Overdraft
- Advance Salary Loan
This case study will focus on the underwriting process behind Personal Loan only

Problem Statement:
Given a set of attributes for an Individual, determine if a credit line should be extended to them. If so, what should the repayment terms be in business recommendations?

Concept Used:

- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Feature Engineering
- Logistic Regression
- Precision Vs Recall Tradeoff
- What does ‘good’ look like?

Import the dataset and do usual exploratory data analysis steps like checking the structure & characteristics of the dataset
Check how much target variable (Loan_Status) depends on different predictor variables (Use count plots, box plots, heat maps etc)
Check correlation among independent variables and how they interact with each other
Simple Feature Engineering steps:
E.g.: Creation of Flags- If value greater than 1.0 then 1 else 0. This can be done on:

1. Pub_rec
2. Mort_acc
3. Pub_rec_bankruptcies

- Missing values and Outlier Treatment
- Scaling - Using MinMaxScaler or StandardScaler
- Use Logistic Regression Model from Sklearn/Statsmodel library and explain the results
Results Evaluation:
- Classification Report
- ROC AUC curve
- Precision recall curve

Tradeoff Questions:
How can we make sure that our model can detect real defaulters and there are less false positives? This is important as we can lose out on an opportunity to finance more individuals and earn interest on it.
Since NPA (non-performing asset) is a real problem in this industry, it’s important we play safe and shouldn’t disburse loans to anyone

- **mort_acc:**
	- Average number of mortgage accounts is ~2 while applying for the loan
	- The Difference between Q3 and max indicates the highly right skewed data
- For pub_rec_bankruptcies, the Difference between Q3 and max indicates the highly right skewed data
- Null Values in the dataset are identified for features mort_acc, emp_title, emp_length, title, pub_rec_bankruptcies and revol_util
- open_acc, pub_rec, mort_acc, pub_rec_bankruptcies are defined as numerical but should be changed to categorical
- Extracted the pincode from the complete textual address, gives following actionable insights
	- Notably, loans were applied from only 10 unique pincodes, suggesting that borrowers are concentrated in a small number of cities. 
	- Also this indicates that the "Loantap" business is not yet widely recognized.
- The majority of loans were issued between 2013 and 2015, with October and July emerging as the top two months for loan approvals
- The distribution of the earliest credit line is left-skewed and centered around the year 2000, indicating that most borrowers began their credit journey during this period
- Following features are highly correlated
    - loan amount and installment
    - open acc and total acc
    - pub rec and pub rec bankruptcies
- Outliers in the data make it challenging to draw meaningful inferences.
- A clear distinction is observed in the distribution of interest rate and DTI (debt-to-income ratio) between loyal customers and defaulters.
- Other features show no significant difference in their distribution relative to the target variable, though this needs to be validated through statistical tests.
- The ratio of fully paid loan to default loan is high on the year 2013
- People with grades ‘A’ are more likely to fully pay their loan
- Loans with a 60-month term are significantly more likely to result in default.
- Professionals with over 10 years of experience show a higher likelihood of defaulting on their loans.
- Verified accounts have a reduced likelihood of being charged off.
- Customers with 0 mortgage accounts are less prone to default.
- The geographical location (pincode) extracted from the address plays a crucial role in influencing loan defaults.
- Mortgaged homeowners show a significant tendency to default on their loans.
- Customers with an A-grade credit rating are substantially less likely to default.
- Other features do not show a significant impact on loan repayment behavior.
- Churn Ratio: No. of Charged off/No. of Fully paid
    - 2015 and 2016 years dominate in churn ratio, hence issue_yr is a contributing factor
    - Churn ratio over months shows similar trend, hence issue_mon doesn't provide significant contribution for churning
- Principal Component Analysis:
	- The first principal component, which explains approximately 65% of the variance in the data, is constructed with nearly equal contributions from all features in the dataset
	- Since all the features equally contribute for PC1, all are comparably important in explaining the variance of the dataset
	- Out of 24 features from the dataset, First 5 principal components captures >60% of variance in data
	- Dimensionality reduction is possible by reducing 4-5 features as it captures <5% of variance in data
- Statistical Tests:
	- The means between the categories for most of the features are significantly different, suggesting that these features could effectively classify loan status
	- Whereas no significant difference between the means of the categories of revol_bal, indicating that this feature may have limited utility in distinguishing between loan statuses during modeling
	- The contingency test confirms that loan status is dependent on most of the categorical features, suggesting their effectiveness in classifying loan status.
	- However, the features pub_rec and pub_rec_bankruptcies show no dependency on loan status, indicating that these features may have limited influence on classification
	- Logistic regression coefficients also confirms the above point
- Modeling:
	- Prediction of positive class is satisfactory as it achieves high precision and recall. High precision may also be the reason that the positive class is the majority class.
	- False Positive Rate: Indicates the misclassification of defaulters. It results in incorrectly approving the loans for defaulters.
	- FPR can result in significant revenue loss, as the bank risks losing the loan's principal amount, which may outweigh potential gains from interest.
	- False Negative Rate: Indicates the misclassification of loyal customers. The bank misses out on good business opportunities by rejecting creditworthy applicants
    - `While this leads to revenue loss in terms of forgone interest, the loss is generally less critical compared to the risk associated with false positives
	- Based on the PR curve of positive class, an optimal threshold of 0.7 is chosen (by trading off between precision and recall)
	- It significantly reduces the false positive rate by 20% and improves the f1 score of negative class by 10%
	- The regression coefficients indicate that subgrade and pincode provides major contribution to the model.
	- Conversely, pub_rec and pub_rec_bankruptcies show negligible contribution, suggesting minimal impact on the target variable.
	- Features such as term, installment, annual_inc, dti, and mort_acc also demonstrate significant contributions to the model
	- Class weightage technique to address the class imbalancement in the dataset doesn't significantly improve the performance



# Business Recommendations:
- Notably, loans were applied from only 10 unique pincodes, suggesting that borrowers are concentrated in a small number of cities. It indicates that the "Loantap" business is not yet widely recognized.
Hence the firm should plan to extend or market it to other regions to increase the revenue
- Due to the significant false positives in the model performance, it is recommended to conduct additional verification before finalizing from model prediction
- Additional features to be included to improve the model performance in future
- 15% of datapoints contain atlease one missing value indicating the data collection to be robust to improve the performance of the model
